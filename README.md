# 🌳 Deforestation Detection Using Deep Learning 🛰️

</div>

This project implements a deep learning model using U-Net architecture to detect deforestation in satellite imagery. The model is trained to segment areas of deforestation from satellite images, providing a powerful tool for monitoring and analyzing forest cover changes.

## 🎯 Project Overview

The project uses a U-Net-based deep learning model to perform semantic segmentation on satellite images, identifying areas where deforestation has occurred. The model is trained on pairs of satellite images and their corresponding deforestation masks.
